# words

Anagram solver stream game.

No real plan for this, but have been playing a fun word game in stream chat.
Figured I would experiment with some data structures for creating one.
And writing on an HTML canvas is a convenient way to do simple graphics.
It can easily be used as a browser source in OBS for including on stream.
TypeScript is used for ease of use with the canvas and my existing bot.
